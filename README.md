A **performance-first NPC Gang Warfare system** for **QBCore FiveM servers**, featuring **hostile AI-controlled gangs**, dynamic territory zones, and global synchronization — all with **0.00ms idle performance**.

This is **not** a laggy, outdated gang script.  
**DHGangWar** was rebuilt from the ground up for modern, optimized servers.

## 🏙️ What This Script Adds

DHGangWar introduces **dangerous gang-controlled zones** across the map where hostile NPC gangs:
- Protect their turf
- Instantly engage players
- Create high-risk, high-reward areas
- Spawn and despawn dynamically based on player proximity

All gangs are **server-managed and globally synchronized**, so every player sees the same threats at the same time.

---

## 🚀 Why This Gang Script Is Different

Most gang scripts:
- Run constant ped loops
- Leave NPCs spawned forever
- Tank server performance

**DHGangWar does none of that.**

✔ No constant AI loops  
✔ No idle ped processing  
✔ No mass entity spam  
✔ No client-side desync  

**Idle usage: ~0.00ms**

## ✨ Key Features

✔ **Dynamic Gang Zones**  
Gangs only spawn when a player enters range (configurable, default 300m).  
They automatically despawn when no players are nearby.

✔ **Global Gang Synchronization**  
If one player triggers a gang spawn → **ALL players see it**.  
The server controls everything.

✔ **Aggressive AI Combat**  
- Immediate aggro on players  
- Configurable vision & hearing range  
- Adjustable combat behavior  
- Multiple ped models per gang  
- Weapon pools per gang  

✔ **Ultra-Optimized Architecture**  
- Ped models preloaded at startup (no stutter)
- Spawns only when required
- Full entity cleanup
- No tick-based ped loops
- Designed for performance-first servers

✔ **Fully Configurable**  
Add unlimited gangs with custom:
- Names
- Spawn coordinates
- Ped models
- Weapon pools
- Ped count
- Spawn radius
- AI aggression & behavior

✔ **Perfect for Criminal RP & PVE Content**  
Ideal for:
- High-risk zones
- Gang-controlled neighborhoods
- Loot-heavy danger areas
- PvE combat content
